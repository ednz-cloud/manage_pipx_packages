manage_pipx_packages
=========

This role enables you to manage python packages using pipx, to comply with the [PEP668](https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/) on **debian-based** distributions. It can be used on its own , or be called by other roles the install/remove packages on demand.

> **Warning**
> This role only supports ubuntu versions starting at 22.04, and debian versions starting a Debian 12. This is due to the pipx package being to out-of-date, or completely absent on older distributions. However, these older distributions typically do not enforce the PEP668, so you can use [ednz_cloud.manage_pip_packages](https://github.com/ednz_cloud/manage_pip_packages) instead.

Requirements
------------

None.

Role Variables
--------------
Available variables are listed below, along with default values. A sample file for the default values is available in `default/manage_pipx_packages.yml.sample` in case you need it for any `group_vars` or `host_vars` configuration.

```yaml
manage_pipx_packages_install_prereqs: true # by default, set to true
```
This variable defines if the prerequisites for the role should be installed. This should be left to true, unless you install python and pipx from another role prior to running this one.

```yaml
manage_pipx_packages_home: "/opt/pipx" # by default, set to /opt/pipx
```
This variable define where the pipx packages should be installed. By default, this is a generic path, in order to not tie the installs to a specific user.

```yaml
manage_pipx_packages_path: "/usr/local/bin" # by default, set to /usr/local/bin
```
This variable defines the path on which to make the package available. Please note that the actual installation will be done on the `manage_pipx_packages_home` path. The path given here will be simlinked to the installed package.

```yaml
manage_pipx_packages_list: # by default, set to install ansible-core
  - name: ansible-core
    version_constraint: latest
    state: present
```
This variable is a list of packages, with their name, desired version and state. `version_constraint` can be multiple constraints,separated by commas (example: `>1.10`, `>1.10,<1.15,!=1.12`,`==1.13`).

> **Warning**
> Currently, and due to limitations in the [ansible pipx module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/pipx_module.html), adding version contraints other that `latest` will break idempotence of this role. This is not breaking your installation of the package, only the task will always be marked as changed on your playbook run. This will be fixed whenever the pipx module is fixed.

Dependencies
------------

None.

Example Playbook
